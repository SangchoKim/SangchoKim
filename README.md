![Santos's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=SangchoKim&show_icons=true&theme=synthwave)
   
  I am a developer who values **"collaboration"** with team members in
          various roles. Because if you are not alone, you can lead to better
          creative results and unexpected possibilities.
          <br />
          <br /> We believe that business growth can be achieved through trust
          between team members.
          
          
  We believe in the infinite possibilities of **effort**. We believe that
          changing yourself is **effort**. <br />
          <br /> When I finished 10 years of playing career due to a 20-year-old
          injury, when I said that I was going to New Zealand without knowing
          how to read English, or when I said that I was going to work as a
          developer after graduating from college, everyone expressed concerns
          that it was an absurd path, but day by day "Effort" of "I" made me who
          I am today.
